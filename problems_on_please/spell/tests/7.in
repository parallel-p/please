Dashingthrough the snow On a one-horse open sleigh Over the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bobtail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight Chorus Jingle bells jingle bells Jingle all the way O what fun it is to ride In a onehorse open sleigh A day or two ago I thought Id take a ride And soon Miss Fanny Bright Was seated by my side The horse was lean and lank Misfortune seemed his lot He got into a drifted bank And we we got upsot Chorus Jingle bells jingle bells Jingle all the way O what fun it is to ride In a onehorse open sleigh A day or two ago The story I must tell I went out on the snow And on my back I fell A gent was riding by In a onehorse open sleigh He laughed as there I sprawling lie But quickly drove away Chorus Jingle bells jingle bells Jingle all the way O what fun it is to ride In a onehorse open sleigh Now the ground is white Go it while youre young Take the girls tonight And sing this sleighing song Just get a bobtailed bay Twoforty as his speed Hitch him to an open sleigh And crack youll take the lead Chorus Jingle bells jingle bells Jingle all the way O what fun it is to ride In a onehorse open sleigh
